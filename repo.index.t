project that combines:

Cybersecurity (Cisco skills) ‚Üí Windows firewall, antivirus, ACL checks, malware scan.

Machine Learning (Oracle ML) ‚Üí Basic anomaly detection on system logs or processes.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
This way, it‚Äôs not just another script ‚Äî it‚Äôs a security tool with AI insights.
Project Features

‚úÖ Check Windows 10/11 firewall, AV, malware scan (like we started).

‚úÖ Export logs (processes, network connections, sign-ins).

‚úÖ Feed logs into a simple ML model (Python, scikit-learn) to detect anomalies.

‚úÖ Output a report in Markdown or CSV with:

Security posture (firewall, AV, MFA).

Any anomalies flagged by ML.

Step 1. PowerShell Script (security-check.ps1)

This script collects firewall, AV, suspicious processes, and logs into a CSV for the ML part.
<# 
.SYNOPSIS
  Windows Security Health Check + Log Export
.DESCRIPTION
  Collects firewall, AV, suspicious processes, and logs for ML analysis.
#>

Write-Host "=== AI-Powered Security Check (2025) ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan

# Firewall
$firewallProfiles = Get-NetFirewallProfile
$firewallProfiles | Select-Object Name, Enabled |
    Export-Csv ".\firewall-status.csv" -NoTypeInformation

# Antivirus
$av = Get-CimInstance -Namespace root/SecurityCenter2 -ClassName AntivirusProduct 2>$null
$av | Select-Object displayName, productState |
    Export-Csv ".\antivirus-status.csv" -NoTypeInformation

# Processes (for anomaly detection)
Get-Process | Select-Object ProcessName, Id, CPU, WS, Path |
    Export-Csv ".\process-logs.csv" -NoTypeInformation

Write-Host "Logs exported: firewall-status.csv, antivirus-status.csv, process-logs.csv"
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Step 2. Python Script (analyze-logs.py)

Uses ML to detect unusual processes (e.g., memory/CPU spikes).
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Load process logs
df = pd.read_csv("process-logs.csv")

# Clean numeric features
features = df[["CPU", "WS"]].fillna(0)

# Train Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05, random_state=42)
df["anomaly"] = model.fit_predict(features)

# Save anomalies
anomalies = df[df["anomaly"] == -1]
anomalies.to_csv("anomalies.csv", index=False)

print("‚úÖ Analysis complete. Found", len(anomalies), "suspicious processes.")
print("Results saved in anomalies.csv")
